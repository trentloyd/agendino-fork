TRANSCRIPTION_PROMPT = """\
Transcribe the following audio recording accurately and completely.
Use the language spoken in the audio — do NOT translate.

Rules:
- Identify distinct speakers and label them as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.
- If a speaker's name is mentioned at any point, replace their generic label with that name throughout the entire transcript.
- Include a timestamp at the start of each new speaker turn in [MM:SS] format.
- Remove filler sounds and hesitation noises (e.g. Mm, Mhm, Uh, Eh, Ah, Um) unless they carry clear communicative intent.
- Mark unclear or inaudible speech as [inaudible].
- Use proper punctuation and paragraph breaks for readability.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or omit content.

Output format:
[00:00] Speaker 1: ...
[00:15] Speaker 2: ...
